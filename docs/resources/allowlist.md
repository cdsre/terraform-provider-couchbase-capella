# couchbase-capella_allowlist (Resource)



Couchbase Capella only allows trusted IP addresses to connect to databases. Each database has a configurable Allowed
IP list that can include up to 75 entries. Each entry can be a single IP address or an IP address space. Any IP address
you add to this list can have a user-specified expiration time for temporary access, or be permanent. Capella
automatically denies any connection attempts to and from an IP not in the allowed IP list.

## Example Usage

Allow all IP addresses:

```terraform
resource "couchbase-capella_allowlist" "allowlist" {
  organization_id = "<organization_id>"
  project_id      = "<project_id>"
  cluster_id      = "<cluster_id>"
  cidr            = "0.0.0.0/0"
  comment         = "allows all ips"
  expires_at      = "2023-12-30T23:59:59.465Z"
}
```


Allow a single IP address:

```terraform
resource "couchbase-capella_allowlist" "allowlist" {
  organization_id = "<organization_id>"
  project_id      = "<project_id>"
  cluster_id      = "<cluster_id>"
  cidr            = "95.75.125.11/32"
  comment         = "allows only my ip"
  expires_at      = "2023-12-30T23:59:59.465Z"
}
```
